Initially at 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures_in_the_world#History" title="List of tallest buildings and structures in the world">tallest man-made structure</a> in the world for over 3,800 years. Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface; what is seen today is the underlying core structure. Some of the casing stones that once covered the structure can still be seen around the base. There have been varying scientific and alternative theories about the Great Pyramid's construction techniques. Most accepted construction hypotheses are based on the 
			idea that it was built by moving huge stones from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarry" title="Quarry">quarry</a> and dragging and lifting them into place.</p>
