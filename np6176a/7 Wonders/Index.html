			<p>The <b>Seven Wonders of the World</b> (or the <b>Seven Wonders of the Ancient World</b>) refers to remarkable constructions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity" title="Classical antiquity">classical antiquity</a><sup id="cite_ref-Anon_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Anon-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> listed by various authors in guidebooks popular among the ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece" title="Ancient Greece">Hellenic</a> tourists, particularly in the 1st and 2nd centuries BC. The most prominent of these, the versions by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipater_of_Sidon" title="Antipater of Sidon">Antipater of Sidon</a> and an observer identified as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_of_Byzantium" title="Philo of Byzantium">Philo of Byzantium</a>, comprise seven works located around the eastern Mediterranean rim. The original list inspired <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonders_of_the_World" title="Wonders of the World">innumerable versions</a> through the ages, often listing seven entries.

(Τὰ ἑπτὰ θεάματα τῆς οἰκουμένης [γῆς] Tà heptà theámata tēs oikoumenēs [gēs]) Later, the word for "wonder" ("thaumata" θαύματα) was used, and this is also the case in modern Greek (Επτά θαύματα του αρχαίου κόσμου).[6] Hence, the list was meant to be the Ancient World's counterpart of a travel guidebook.[3]</p>

			<p>Each person had his own version of the list, but the best known and earliest surviving was from a poem by Greek-speaking epigrammist Antipater of Sidon from around 140 BC.[5] He named six of the seven sites on his list (leaving out the lighthouse), but was primarily in praise of the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus:</p>
