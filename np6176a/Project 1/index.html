			<p>About The Cup</p>
			<p>In the Spring of 1994, The Cup opened for business at 558 Nevada Way in the Old Town area of Boulder City, Nevada. Carri, my wife, worked as a waitress, and I washed dishes and cooked back up. We also had another dishwasher, two other cooks and a bus boy. Life was good. Carri and I worked 7 days per week and our kids, Lindsay and Terry, helped out. Lindsay and Terry made biscuits after school while Carri and I did prep work.</p>
			<p>In January of 2003 we bought an old restaurant in Old Town. It had 3,000 square feet and a giant kitchen. Just what we were looking for! We went through a lengthy and expensive remodeling experience and finally, late in the year, moved The Cup to its new home at 512 Nevada Way.</p>
			<p>Today, business is great! We employ 4 cooks, 1 prep cook, 2 dishwashers, 6 waitresses, 5 bus girls and a hostess. Carri and I still work 7 days per week. Local Boulder City folks are our mainstay. We love our everyday people. We know most of them by their first names and we know just what they like to eat.</p>
			<p>We have many visitors come in from all over the world. Some bring coffee cups from home and we hang them around The Cup. Many visitors who are staying in nearby Las Vegas come up to The Cup just to escape the noise of downtown. They come to Boulder City to relax and have some real home cookin’.</p>
			<p>All of our food is cooked fresh to order. Many of our menu items are customer-driven. We began by cooking special orders, and after a while we decided to put the special items on the menu!&nbsp; We cook and prepare all of our food in-house. All of our gravys, our meatloaf, roast beef, chili and chili verde sauce, potato salad, cole slaw, and tuna salad are all our own special recipes.</p>
			<p>The Food Network came to Boulder City recently and did a piece on The Cup. Our&nbsp; great food, our specials and our loyal, regular customers were highlighted. We had a ball with host Guy Fieri. He will use The Cup’s piece in his new show, “Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.”&nbsp; It should air in the first part of May, 2007.</p>
			<p>Come in to The Cup and see what all the fuss is about!&nbsp; Besides our award-winning, excellent, home-made food, we have lots of fun pictures and props to look at.&nbsp; And of course, we can’t forget our great customers!&nbsp; We can’t wait to see you too!</p>
