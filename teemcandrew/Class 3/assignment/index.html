				<p>A space to expand your <span><i>mind</i></span> and <span><i>body</i></span>.  Get ready to stretch!</p>

				<p>Bikram Yoga is an intelligently designed sequence of 26 yoga postures and 2 breathing exercises performed in a heated room. Each posture stretches and strengthens the specific muscles, ligaments, and joints needed for the next posture. The heated room provides a safe environment, allowing for deep stretching without the risk of injury, helping to relieve resistant joints, muscles and ligaments as well as develop strength of mind, focus and determination.</p>
				
				<p>Bikram yoga works by systematically stretching, squeezing, and massaging the internal organs, spine, muscles, tendons, and joints. It flushes out the cardiovascular system, and stimulates the endocrine, nervous, and reproductive systems. Toxins are eliminated. The central nervous system is both energized and soothed. The lymphatic system is flushed out and the immune system is built up, restoring all systems in the body to healthy working order- just as nature intended!</p>
