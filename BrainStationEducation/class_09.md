# Week 5 - Class 9 : Introduction to Bootstrap Components 

## In Class

We're going to dig deeper into the Bootstrap framework. Bootstrap provides us with over a dozen reusable components built to provide iconography, drop-downs, input groups, navigation, alerts, and much more. The most important components we’ll be using will be the button groups and navigation.

**Some important things to keep in mind:**

- Always create your own stylesheet to override Bootstrap styles. Structuring it this way will allow you to quickly swap the Bootstrap CSS with any new updates that are released in the future.
- You may use the [hosted](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download-cdn) version of Bootstrap CSS files or have them locally in your folder. Both have their pros & cons.
- Always link your own stylesheet AFTER the Bootstrap stylesheet in the head section of your html document. Otherwise, your style overrides will not function. 
- In order for the navigation to function properly, you must include jQuery and Javascript files in your project.   

We’ve put a quick example together. You can access it [here](http://codepen.io/BrainStationEDU/pen/ucvKi).

**Some of the things we'll be doing:**

- Setting up a Fixed Bootstrap navigation using rules defined above.  
- Exploring the various components such as Buttons, Glyph icons etc. and how to implement and customize them in your website.
