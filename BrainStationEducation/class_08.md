# Week 4 - Class 8 : Introduction Bootstrap’s Responsive Grid System

## In Class

We're going to dig deeper intro the Bootstrap grid system. Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases. It includes predefined classes for easy layout options, as well as powerful mixins for generating more semantic layouts.

**Some important things to keep in mind:**

- Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding.
- Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns.
- Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows.
- Grid columns are created by specifying the number of twelve available columns you wish to span. For example, three equal columns would use three .col-xs-4.

We’ve put a quick example together. You can access it [here](http://codepen.io/BrainStationEDU/pen/wAodF).

**Some of the things we'll be doing:**

- Setting up a simple grid using Bootstrap rules defined above.  
- Using Offsets, Nesting and visibility classes to further customize the grid layout.



## Learning Objectives

Students should understand the following:

### Bootstrap

- Media queries used by the Bootstrap grid system.
- How to use class prefix to specify device size (col-xs, col-sm, col-md, col-lg).
- Know how the grid behaves at each breakpoint (screen size).
- Using offsetting and nesting to further customize page layout.
- Understand how to use visibility classes and column ordering (push/pull) to change content based on screen size. 

## Assignments

#### Implement the bootstrap grid in your restaurants site:

- Do not edit the original restaurant website. Create a new project and copy the content from the old site.
- You may use the hosted version of the bootstrap files or store them locally in the website folder.
- Any overrides to the Bootstrap CSS must be done in a separate CSS file (Do not make edits to the original Boostrap CSS).
- Use Git to track the changes to your site as you work.
- Push your creation to your GitHub profile.
- Be prepared to share your code in class.
