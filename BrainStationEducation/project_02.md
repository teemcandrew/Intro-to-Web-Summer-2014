# Project 2 : Build a website for a product.

## Description

The way you present your product or service is essential to its success. On the Web, like anywhere else, the first impression you make on people is crucial. When selling a product, you want that first impression to be as positive and remarkable as possible.

If people don’t understand what you are offering them or how it works, they will lose interest quickly. Show them that your product is just what they want, that it’s useful and that it adds some kind of value to their lives.

Your mission (if you choose to accept it) is to build a kick-ass product page. It can be anything from a cool wearable technology such as the MYO by Thalmic Labs to a sexy car company like Tesla. Pick your favourite product and let your imagination run wild! 

**Some cool product sites we like:**

- [Google Nexus 5](http://www.google.ca/nexus/5/)
- [NYMI Bracelet] (http://www.getnymi.com/)
- [Volkswagon] (http://www.vw.com/)

## Project Details

**Your project must incorporate the following:**

#### Site Elements

- BootStrap Grid System
	- Implement the bootstrap grid in your product site. Website must be responsive for the iPhone, iPad and Laptop.
	- You must use columns offsets, nesting and ordering at least once in the site. 
	- You must also have at least one instance of visibility classes in your site. 

- Site Navigation
	- Implement a “fixed” Bootstrap navigation. 
	- It must resize to a mobile button for smaller screen sizes.
	- The navigation must be customized according to your product’s colour theme. Feel free to add drop shadow effects etc. using CSS. 
	- Navigation should contain a Buy Now or Pre-order button on the right. 

- Modal 
	- Implement a Bootstrap Modal that links to the button (Buy Now/Pre-order) in your site’s navigation.
	- Modal should contain HTML form elements. Eventhough the form will not actually be linked to any database, treat it as so. You may collect information such as 	  Name, Address and Credit Card. 

- Scrollspy 
	- Your navigation must make use of Scrollspy (i.e. navigation updates according to content on screen).

- Carousel or Collapse
	- Your site must contain an instance of either a Collapse or a Carousel.
