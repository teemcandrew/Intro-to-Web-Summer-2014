# Week 4 - Class 8 : Introduction Bootstrap JavaScript

## In Class

We're going to work with Bootstrap JavaScript components today. Bootstrap comes with some very cool jQuery plugins such as modals, tabs, collapse and carousel. You can implement them by using the JavaScript API or through markup API (Data attributes). 

**Some important things to keep in mind:**

- Plugins can be included individually (using Bootstrap's individual *.js files), or all at once (using bootstrap.js or the minified bootstrap.min.js).
- Both bootstrap.js and bootstrap.min.js contain all plugins in a single file. Include only one.
- Don't use data attributes from multiple plugins on the same element. For example, a button cannot both have a tooltip and toggle a modal. To accomplish this, use a wrapping element.
- Some plugins and CSS components depend on other plugins. If you include plugins individually, make sure to check for these dependencies in the docs. Also note that all plugins depend on jQuery (this means jQuery must be included before the plugin files).
 
Weâ€™ve put a quick example together. You can access it [here](http://codepen.io/BrainStationEDU/pen/wAodF).

**Some of the things we'll be doing:**

- Implementing modals, collapse and carousel in our websites.  
- Taking a deep dive into some intense JavaScript.


## Learning Objectives

Students should understand the following:
