			<p><span>Christopher Emmanuel <a href="http://www.nba.com/playerfile/chris_paul/">"Chris" Paul</a> (born May 6, 1985) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Clippers of the <a href="http://www.nba.com">National Basketball Association (NBA)</a>. He is my favourite NBA player.</p>

<p>Paul was born and raised in North Carolina. Despite only playing two varsity basketball seasons in high school, he was a McDonald's All-American and accepted a scholarship with nearby Wake Forest University. After his sophomore year with the Demon Deacons, he declared for the draft. Since being selected 4th overall in the 2005 NBA Draft by the New Orleans Hornets, Paul has been an NBA Rookie of the Year (2006), a seven-time All-Star, an All-Star Game Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a multiple-time All-NBA and All-Defensive team honoree. He has won three playoff series in his career, never advancing beyond the second round. He has also won two Olympic gold medals with the United States national basketball team.</p>

<p>On August 21, 2013, Paul was elected the National Basketball Players Association president.</p>
