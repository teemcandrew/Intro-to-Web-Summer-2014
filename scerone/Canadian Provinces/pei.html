				<p>During July and August, the average daytime high in PEI is 23 degrees Celsius (73º Fahrenheit), however, the temperature can sometimes exceed 30 degrees (86 Fahrenheit) during these months. In the winter months of January and February, the average daytime high is -3.3 degrees Celsius (26 F). The Island receives an average yearly rainfall of 855&nbsp;mm and an average yearly snowfall of 285&nbsp;cm.</p>
				<p>Winters are moderately cold, with clashes of cold Arctic air and milder Atlantic air causing frequent temperature swings. From December to April, the island usually has many storms (which may produce rain as well as snow) and blizzards. Springtime temperatures typically remain cool until the sea ice has melted, usually in late April or early May. Summers are moderately warm, but rarely uncomfortable, with the daily maximum temperature only occasionally reaching as high as 30&nbsp;°C (86&nbsp;°F). Autumn is a pleasant season, as the moderating Gulf waters delay the onset of frost, although storm activity increases compared to the summer. There is ample precipitation throughout the year, although it is heaviest in the late autumn, early winter and mid spring.</p>
